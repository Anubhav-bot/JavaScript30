    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const player0 = players.slice()
    player0[0] = 'player0'

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const player1 = [].concat(players);
    player1[1] = 'player1'

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const player2 = [...players]
    player2[2] = 'player2'

    const player3 = Array.from(players)
    player3[3] = 'player3'

    console.table({players, player0, player1, player2, player3})

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const p1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12});
    //or
    const p2 = Object.assign({}, person)
    p2.age = 15;

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const p2 = [...person];

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    console.table({person, p1, p2})

    const peepool = {
      name: 'me',
      socials: {
        facebook: 'meme',
        instagram: 'reel'
      }
    }

    const peepol_copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(peepool))
    const pp1 = Object.assign({}, peepol_copy)
    pp1.socials.facebook = 'new'

    console.table({peepool, peepol_copy, pp1})
